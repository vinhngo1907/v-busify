                                In 2023, the BitByte members from the batch of 2021 came up with
                                an idea of organizing a summer event called BitByte Summer of
                                Code (BSOC). The goal was to inspire juniors to participate in
                                open-source programs and gain experience by working on impactful
                                projects. One of the key projects for this event was Busify.
                                During the 2023 BSOC event, significant progress was made, with
                                nearly half of the project completed. The work continued into
                                BSOC 2024, with the 2023 batch making substantial contributions.
                                We really wished that there would be someday when this project
                                will actually be used by our institute as this project signifies
                                the effort and collaboration of 2021, 2022 & 2023 batches. We
                                believe Busify will serve as an inspiration for future batches,
                                encouraging them to develop practical solutions to real-life
                                problems.
